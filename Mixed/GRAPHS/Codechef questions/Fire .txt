Explaination:
(1,2,3) (4)
3*1 ways and 2 components so 2 and 3
(1,2,3) (4) (5)
3 groups, and 3*1*1 components
(1,2) (3,4) (5,6)
3 groups, and 2*2*2=8 components

so basically, we have to traverse through all the edges and find the number of connected components and for each component maintain the number of vertices in each of the components in a vector coz you later have to traverse through that vector and multiply and display as the output.


Important:
Codechef doesn't accept #define int long long , and int32_t main()
